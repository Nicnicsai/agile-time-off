# Time-Off
An educational travel game to acquire inspiration for future travels.

## Why we created a slotmachine?
Just like with a regular slotmachine, you *never* know what to expect, everything is a surprise. In this way we offer a similar experience for discovering odd places around the globe. 

## How does it work?
When spinning the slotmachine you get a city in a country depending on a *random* continent. You also get unique and interesting experiences in the area. 
We fetch all this information from 4 different API's, to deliver the best results in a beautiful and easy way to read.
